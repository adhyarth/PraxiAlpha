## Phase 1: Foundation & Data Pipeline

### Session 1 — 2026-03-13: Project Scaffolding

#### What We Did
1. ✅ **Finalized DESIGN_DOC.md** (v1.1)
   - Chose EODHD as primary data provider (over Yahoo Finance — more reliable, better API)
   - Chose FRED for macro/economic data (free, official Fed data)
   - Scoped full US universe (~49K tickers, 30+ years)
   - Estimated storage: ~12 GB for OHLCV data

2. ✅ **Created full project scaffolding** (125 files)
   - Backend: FastAPI app, config, database, models, API routes, services, tasks, tests
   - Scripts: setup_db.py, backfill_data.py
   - Docker: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml (5 services)
   - Config: pyproject.toml, alembic.ini, .env, .gitignore

3. ✅ **Fixed build issues**
   - Dockerfile: needed to copy all code before `pip install -e .`
   - pyproject.toml: changed build backend from legacy to `setuptools.build_meta`
   - pyproject.toml: added explicit package discovery (`include = ["backend*"]`) — setuptools was confused by multiple top-level directories
   - DailyOHLCV model: changed from `id` primary key to composite `(stock_id, date)` primary key — required by TimescaleDB (partitioning column must be in PK)

4. ✅ **Started Docker stack**
   - All 5 containers running: db, redis, app, celery-worker, celery-beat
   - FastAPI serving on http://localhost:8000
   - Celery worker connected to Redis, 4 tasks registered
   - Celery beat scheduler running

5. ✅ **Set up database**
   - TimescaleDB extension enabled
   - 3 tables created: `stocks`, `daily_ohlcv`, `macro_data`
   - `daily_ohlcv` converted to TimescaleDB hypertable

6. ✅ **Populated stocks table**
   - Fetched 49,225 US tickers from EODHD exchange symbol list
   - All inserted into `stocks` table

7. 🔜 **Next: Test backfill** (10 blue-chip tickers)

#### Issues Encountered
- EODHD API key from initial session was expired → user got new key
- FRED API key was also invalid → user got new key  
- VS Code Copilot chat UI froze during long operation → restarted, no data lost (Docker volumes persisted)
- TimescaleDB hypertable creation failed initially because `id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY` didn't include the `date` partition column → fixed by making `(stock_id, date)` the composite PK

#### Current Database State
| Table | Rows | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| `stocks` | 49,225 | ✅ Populated |
| `daily_ohlcv` | 0 | ⏳ Awaiting backfill |
| `macro_data` | 0 | ⏳ Awaiting FRED backfill |

#### Git Commits
- `Initial commit — full project scaffolding` (125 files)

### Session 2 — 2026-03-13: Test Backfill & Bug Fix

#### What We Did
1. ✅ **Created new database models** — Splits & Dividends
   - `backend/models/split.py` — `StockSplit` model (records stock split events with ratio, numerator, denominator)
   - `backend/models/dividend.py` — `StockDividend` model (records dividend payments with declaration, record, and payment dates)
   - Updated `backend/models/__init__.py` to export new models
   - Updated `backend/models/stock.py` with relationships to splits and dividends
   - Updated `scripts/setup_db.py` to include new models in table creation

2. ✅ **Ran test backfill** (`--test` with 10 blue-chip tickers)
   - Initial run: only 2 of 10 stocks (META, TSLA) loaded data — the other 8 silently failed

3. ✅ **Diagnosed the bug** — PostgreSQL parameter limit overflow
   - PostgreSQL has a hard limit of ~32,767 parameters per query
   - Each OHLCV row has 8 columns, so max ~4,000 rows per INSERT
   - Stocks like AAPL, MSFT, JPM have 9,000+ rows of history (back to 1990) → exceeded the limit
   - META (~3,474 rows) and TSLA (~3,951 rows) squeaked under the limit, which is why they worked
   - The error was **silent** — SQLAlchemy/asyncpg didn't raise a visible exception, the insert just failed

4. ✅ **Fixed the bug** — Batched database inserts
   - Modified `backfill_single_stock()` in `scripts/backfill_data.py`
   - Added `BATCH_SIZE = 3000` (3,000 rows × 8 columns = 24,000 params, safely under 32,767)
   - Inserts now loop in chunks instead of one massive statement

5. ✅ **Added splits & dividends backfill**
   - Extended `scripts/backfill_data.py` with `backfill_splits_dividends()` function
   - Fetches split and dividend history from EODHD for each stock
   - Called automatically after OHLCV backfill for each ticker

6. ✅ **Verified all 10 test stocks loaded successfully**

#### Test Backfill Results
| Ticker | Records | Date Range | Splits | Dividends |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|-----------|
| AAPL | 9,116 | 1990-01-02 → 2026-03-13 | 4 | 79 |
| AMZN | 7,252 | 1997-05-15 → 2026-03-13 | 4 | 0 |
| GOOGL | 5,426 | 2004-08-19 → 2026-03-13 | 2 | 8 |
| JPM | 9,116 | 1990-01-02 → 2026-03-13 | 2 | 147 |
| META | 3,474 | 2012-05-18 → 2026-03-13 | 0 | 9 |
| MSFT | 9,116 | 1990-01-02 → 2026-03-13 | 8 | 91 |
| NVDA | 6,827 | 1999-01-22 → 2026-03-13 | 6 | 54 |
| TSLA | 3,951 | 2010-06-29 → 2026-03-13 | 2 | 0 |
| UNH | 9,116 | 1990-01-02 → 2026-03-13 | 5 | 85 |
| V | 4,525 | 2008-03-19 → 2026-03-13 | 1 | 71 |
| **Total** | **67,919** | | **34** | **544** |

#### Issues Encountered
- Silent insert failures due to PostgreSQL parameter limit — no error raised, data just didn't persist
- Diagnosed by comparing row counts: META/TSLA (shorter history) worked; AAPL/MSFT/JPM (30+ years) didn't
- Confirmed EODHD API was returning valid data for all tickers — the problem was purely on the DB insert side

#### Current Database State
| Table | Rows | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| `stocks` | 49,225 | ✅ Populated |
| `daily_ohlcv` | 67,919 | ✅ Test backfill complete (10 stocks) |
| `stock_splits` | 34 | ✅ Test backfill complete (10 stocks) |
| `stock_dividends` | 544 | ✅ Test backfill complete (10 stocks) |
| `macro_data` | 0 | ⏳ Awaiting FRED backfill |

#### Files Changed
- `backend/models/split.py` — **NEW** — StockSplit model
- `backend/models/dividend.py` — **NEW** — StockDividend model
- `backend/models/__init__.py` — Added split/dividend exports
- `backend/models/stock.py` — Added splits/dividends relationships
- `scripts/backfill_data.py` — Batched inserts + splits/dividends backfill
- `scripts/setup_db.py` — Added split/dividend imports for table creation

#### Git Commits
- `Phase 2: Test backfill — 10 stocks, 67K records, splits & dividends`

## Lessons Learned

| # | Lesson | Context |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | API keys expire — always test before building pipelines | Both EODHD and FRED keys were invalid on first try |
| 2 | TimescaleDB requires partition column in primary key | Can't use a simple `id` PK on hypertables |
| 3 | Docker volumes persist data through container restarts | VS Code crash didn't lose any database data |
| 4 | `lru_cache` + `pydantic-settings` = cached settings at import time | Need container recreation (not just restart) when .env changes |
| 5 | Setuptools auto-discovery fails with multiple top-level dirs | Must explicitly set `packages.find.include` in pyproject.toml |
| 6 | PostgreSQL has a ~32,767 parameter limit per query | Bulk inserts must be batched — 3,000 rows × 8 cols = 24K params is safe |
| 7 | Silent failures are the worst bugs | The insert didn't raise an error — only noticed because row counts were wrong |
| 8 | Compare working vs. failing cases to diagnose | META/TSLA (small history) worked; AAPL/MSFT (large history) didn't → pointed to size-related issue |
